                    <p class="project-description">In the summer of 2023, I and two peers created a 
                        web application that allows a user to sign in with their Spotify account and will then recommend concerts on Ticketmaster
                        based on their musical preferences</p>
                    <p>To build this, I worked with two peers to develop a Flask web app that recommends concert tickets based on a user's Spotify listening
                        history, top artists, and related artists using the Spotify API and Ticketmaster API</p>
                    <p>We implemented Python Pickle serialization/deserialization techniques to optimize data storage and retrieval, reducing the
                        frequency of Ticketmaster API calls as the user base scaled, resulting in greatly improved program efficiency.</p>
                    <p>And we utilized session management to preserve login states across web pages while maintaining security through OAuth 2.0
                        implementation for protected user authentication</p>
                    <p> Disclaimer: the app won't work for the general public because we're still waiting on approval from Spotify for the project</p>

                    <p class="project-description">
                        My name is Pranav Civi. I'm a junior at Texas A&M, pursuing a BS in computer science with a minor in mathematics and I'm also a Brown Scholars Engineering Honors student. <br><br>
                        One significant milestone in my professional journey was my software engineering internship at Verizon Communications where I worked closely with internal Verizon teams to automate extraction, transformation, and displaying of data. During this experience, I worked with 4G and 5G IPv4/IPv6 KPI user data to create an automated dashboard for capital and operational expenditure budgeting, which resulted in predicted annual capital savings of $1.15M. This internship introduced me to RESTful APIs, MySQL databases, and Cron job schedulers.<br><br>
                        In the summer of 2022, I interned at Cognitus Consulting as an SAP Technical Consultant Intern where I was introduced to SAP Hana Cloud databases and SAP development environments. Here my contributions included establishing connectivity from Business Application Studio to SAP Hana Cloud using Node.js, creating a Cloud Foundry App for users to interact with the Hana Cloud database, and implementing a feature that enables users to upload CSV files from their local drives to the cloud database.<br><br>
                        I have completed various projects during school and hackathons, but my favorite is a personal passion project called “Tunes to Tickets”, a Python-based web application built on the Flask framework. It recommends concerts from Ticketmaster based on a user’s Spotify listening history and musical preferences, making use of both Spotify and Ticketmaster APIs. The project’s efficiency is enhanced through Python Pickle serialization for optimized data storage and retrieval which allows it to run faster as the user base scales. Moreover, it ensures user security via OAuth 2.0 while maintaining session management for seamless login experiences.<br><br>
                        Moving forward, I'm excited to be participating in the 2023 J.P. Morgan Code for Good hackathon where I will be collaborating with other students to develop solutions for non-profit organizations.<br><br>
                        After I graduate, I see myself continuing my career as a prospective software engineer. I hope to contribute to a technology company, where I can play a pivotal role in driving innovation forward.<br><br>
