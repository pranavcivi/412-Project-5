                    <p>During the summer of 2023, I interned at Verizon as a Software Engineering Intern. Here are my accomplishments:</p>
                    <p class="project-description">I developed a real-time KPI dashboard to forecast projected subscriber user growth from 4G and 5G IPv4/IPv6 Core data for
                        capex/opex budgeting which resulted in predicted annual capital savings of $1.15M<br></p>
                    <p>I automated data extraction, collection, and storage from Aether platform to a MySQL database using a Python script and
                        Cron jobs on a Verizon Ubuntu server which increased program efficiency by 90%<br></p>
                    <p>I displayed trends in total throughput by creating a REST API using Node.js with an Express framework, HTML, CSS, and
                        Google Chart API<br></p>
                    <p>I implemented various filter options on the dashboard using Google Chart API allowing end-users to selectively view
                        curated data<br></p>
                    <p>And I utilized Gitlab for robust version control throughout the project's development, consistently using commits and pull
                        requests to ensure seamless collaboration and a well-maintained code base

                    <p class="project-description">I established Business Application Studio to SAP Hana Cloud connectivity using Node.js</p>
                    <p>I utilized Dev Spaces and server instances to create a Hana Cloud App that gives users CRUD capabilities for Hana Cloud
                        Database using Node.js, SQL, and Postman</p>
                    <p>And used JavaScript, SQL, and HTML to allow an end user to upload CSV files from local storage into SAP Hana Cloud</p>

                    <p class="project-description">In the summer of 2023, I and two peers created a 
                        web application that allows a user to sign in with their Spotify account and will then recommend concerts on Ticketmaster
                        based on their musical preferences</p>
                    <p>To build this, I worked with two peers to develop a Flask web app that recommends concert tickets based on a user's Spotify listening
                        history, top artists, and related artists using the Spotify API and Ticketmaster API</p>
                    <p>We implemented Python Pickle serialization/deserialization techniques to optimize data storage and retrieval, reducing the
                        frequency of Ticketmaster API calls as the user base scaled, resulting in greatly improved program efficiency.</p>
                    <p>And we utilized session management to preserve login states across web pages while maintaining security through OAuth 2.0
                        implementation for protected user authentication</p>
                    <p> Disclaimer: the app won't work for the general public because we're still waiting on approval from Spotify for the project</p>

                        I'm Pranav Civi, a Junior Computer Science major at Texas A&M University. My passion lies in software-related technology, 
                        and I eagerly seize every opportunity to expand my knowledge. <br><br>One significant milestone in my journey is my Summer 2023 Internship 
                        at Verizon Communications. During this experience, I worked with 4G and 5G IPv4/IPv6 KPI data where I extracted and collected data 
                        from data lakes, then reformatted and displayed information for internal Verizon team members. This internship introduced me to RESTful 
                        APIs, MySQL databases, and Cron jobs. At work I used Python, Node.js, SQL, and HTML/CSS.<br><br> In the summer of 2022, I interned at Cognitus 
                        Consulting as an SAP Technical Consultant Intern, where I was introduced to SAP Hana Cloud databases and development environments. Here 
                        my contributions included establishing connectivity from Business Application Studio to SAP Hana Cloud using Node.js, creating a Cloud 
                        Foundry App for users to interact with the Hana Cloud database, and implementing a feature enabling users to upload CSV files from their 
                        local drives to the cloud database.<br><br> My favorite personal project is "Tunes to Tickets," a Python-based web application built on the Flask 
                        framework. It recommends concerts from Ticketmaster based on a user's Spotify listening history and musical preferences, making use of both 
                        Spotify and Ticketmaster APIs. The project's efficiency is enhanced through Python Pickle serialization for optimized data storage and retrieval 
                        which allows it to run faster as the user base scales. Moreover, it ensures user security via OAuth 2.0 while maintaining session management for 
                        seamless login experiences. <br><br>This October, I look forward to participating in the J.P. Morgan Code for Good Hackathon, collaborating with other 
                        students to develop solutions for non-profit organizations. <br><br>My long-term aspirations involve contributing to a technology company, where I can 
                        play a pivotal role in driving innovation forward.
