                    <p class="project-description">I developed a real-time KPI dashboard to forecast projected subscriber user growth from 4G and 5G IPv4/IPv6 Core data for
                        capex/opex budgeting which resulted in predicted annual capital savings of $1.15M</p>
                    <p>I automated data extraction, collection, and storage from Aether platform to a MySQL database using a Python script and
                        Cron jobs on a Verizon Ubuntu server which increased program efficiency by 90%</p>
                    <p>I displayed trends in total throughput by creating a REST API using Node.js with an Express framework, HTML, CSS, and
                        Google Chart API</p>
                    <p>I implemented various filter options on the dashboard using Google Chart API allowing end-users to selectively view
                        curated data</p>
                    <p>And utilized Gitlab for robust version control throughout the project's development, consistently using commits and pull
                        requests to ensure seamless collaboration and a well-maintained code base

                    <p class="project-description">This web application allows a user to sign in with their Spotify account and will then recommend concerts on Ticketmaster
                        based on their musical preferences</p>
                    <p>To build this, I worked with two peers to develop a Flask web app that recommends concert tickets based on a user's Spotify listening
                        history, top artists, and related artists using the Spotify API and Ticketmaster API</p>
                    <p>We implemented Python Pickle serialization/deserialization techniques to optimize data storage and retrieval, reducing the
                        frequency of Ticketmaster API calls as the user base scaled, resulting in greatly improved program efficiency.</p>
                    <p>And we utilized session management to preserve login states across web pages while maintaining security through OAuth 2.0
                        implementation for protected user authentication</p>
                    <p> Disclaimer: the app won't work for the general public because we're still waiting on approval from Spotify for the project</p>
